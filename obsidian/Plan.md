**Setup:**
✅ Set up a new domain and email adress.
✅ Create a new github account to track progress.
		Github account will also serve as a prove of the work and a portfolio. 
✅ Set up a folder on computer that will be used for this project. This folder will be synced to github. The folder includes these notes. 
✅ Get a basic understanding of how git works. Skip to the git part of  "[The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/)" 
✅ Update 2023-09-20: I've installed lazyvim and intend to do any excersises in there. I had my own config earlier but it was taking a lot of time to get everything configured.

**Curriculum**
I mostly will try to follow the curriculum as described on the OSSU repo. I have found that EDx is excluding quite a lot of content if you are not willing to pay, which I am not, so I might find other resources for these things. I worry that some things might be dated

Update 2023-09-19: The OSSU repo has not been updated since 2017. It seems i'll need to do some of my own work in creating a curriculum. 

I found https://teachyourselfcs.com/ witch offers it's own curriculum.
There is also: https://functionalcs.github.io/curriculum/#org6d18dbf It's opinions seem to align with mine
https://github.com/jwasham/coding-interview-university
https://roadmap.sh/computer-science
some random reddit post: https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/gsansp/my_55step_selftaught_cs_curriculum_updated/
I see many recommendations for SICP.
this seems really good for web: https://fullstackopen.com/en/about

I like the way that Roadmap.sh shows what there is to learn. I think it would be nice if I could build a map like that for what I have learned and link to projects/repos that show my work. 

Finish cs50P
Build homeassistant integration as a final project
